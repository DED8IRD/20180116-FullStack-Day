# Objectives & Overview

## Objectives

- Practical knowledge of Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Django
- Theoretical knowledge of the fundamental concepts of programming

- Growth mentality, the ability to self-teach, the ability to reason through problems on your own
- Communication skills, the ability to explain complex technical concepts in simple terms

## Course Overview

This course is a sling-shot into a professional software development career, it is immersive and pragmatic. We focus on understanding the principles in context, how they play out in practice. Most classes will consist of a lecture followed by a lab. While we're working on our labs, you're free to use the entirety of the space.

The class will use a repo for viewing docs, labs, and solutions. This is also where you will submit your own solutions, in a folder with your name. Your solution must solve the specific problem outlined in the lab.

Make an honest attempt before you ask for help on a lab. Look carefully at the error message and where in the code it's occurring. Look through the provided resources, look at previous labs, research the problem on google and stack overflow. If you're stuck after 15 minutes of review and research, please ask for help, either from another student, a TA, or the instructor.

Many labs will have an 'advanced' section, which are additional features you can complete if you have the time or the desire, and may require you to do additional research. Do not work on them until you are done with the basic version of the assignment. Advanced requirements will enable you to reach into the more advanced topics of the course, and will give you a deeper understanding of the language.

Don't consider an assignment 'finished' until it's been thoroughly tested. Try many different inputs and verify the output. Check for 'edge' cases or unexpected user input. I'll review your solutions from time to time and verify that they successfully fit the requirements of the assignment. If they don't, you'll need to fix them.

Occasionally we'll do pair programming for a lab. This means you and a partner will collaborate on a single lab. Ensure that neither of you is in control of the keyboard for the majority of the time. Alternate roles between directing (talking about what needs to be done) and driving (actually typing). We'll also occasionally do code reviews, where someone presents their program to the class and walks us through how each part works.

Occasionally we'll have one-on-one sessions so that I (the instructor) can ensure that each student is on-track with the material.

There will be three presentations. One at the end of the Python section, one at the end of the JavaScript section, and one for the capstone. These are opportunities to exercise your technical vocabulary. Being able to speak intelligently about programming is almost as important as programming itself. If you can explain technical concepts in simple terms, you'll be better at networking and interviewing, better at communicating with teammates and clients and bosses, you'll be able to give tech talks and conferences, etc.

Tutoring outside of class is free and can be scheduled with the instructor.

## Curriculum Overview

### What is programming?

A program is a series of instructions given to a computer which perform operations on data, transforming input into output. We write our instructions, or 'source code' in text files, then 'run' those instructions by giving the file to the python interpreter.

### Why Python?

- It has a great community, active development
- It has a wide variety of libraries and resources
- It can be used for game dev, web dev, data science, etc
- It'll be easy to adapt your skills to other languages
- https://docs.python.org/3/

### Why Django?

- It has a great community, active development
- It enables the quick development of web applications
- Web dev is very popular (& lucrative)
