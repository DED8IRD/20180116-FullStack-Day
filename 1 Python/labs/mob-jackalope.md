# Mob Programming: Jackalope Simulator

## Version 1

The goal is to calculate how many years it will take for two jackalopes to create a population of 1000.

- Jackalopes are reproductive from ages 4-8 and die at age 10.
- Gestation is instantaneous. Each gestation produces two offspring.
- Jackalopes are hermaphrodites, it takes a pair to reproduce, but any pair will do

With these conditions in mind, we can represent our population as a list of ints.


## Version 2

Now let's give the Jackalopes distinct sexes and extend their gestation to one year. We can represent each Jackalope with a dictionary, thus our population will be a list of ductionaries.
