# CSS Responsive Design

With the uniquity of smart phones and tablets, it's imperative that your website adapts to whatever device a user has. One option is to check the screen width or the [user agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent), and redirect to a mobile version of the site (example [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/redirect-mobile-devices/)). The problem with this approach is that you have to maintain two versions of the same site.

A better approach is to have your website resize to match any screen, this is called "responsive design". You can read more about responsive design on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Progressive/Responsive/responsive_design_building_blocks) and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_intro.asp).

Many [CSS frameworks](03%20-%20CSS%20Overview.md#css-frameworks) have responsiveness built-in. Flexbox and CSS Grid also help.

To help you test, there are various browser extensions to change your browser's size to match that of phones and tables: [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/window-resizer-webextension/), [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh?hl=en), [safari](http://resizesafari.com/).
