# Lab 2: Blog

Let's make the template of a blog with a title, top-nav and multiple posts. Use the [semantic elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) header, nav, section, and footer. You can make generate fake content using [Lorem Ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/). 

Feel free to use a CSS framework like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/), or others in the [additional resources doc](../docs/Additional%20Resources.md). You may also want to use [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) or [grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/).

You may also want to look into [responsive design](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_intro.asp).
