"""
Let's play Connect Four!

# requirements gathering
7 columns, 6 rows
2 players, red and black, take turns adding chips
win condition - 4 in a row, diagonal/vertical/horizontal

# design and planning
board: list of lists of ints
    string containing names of colors
player representation:
    players manually entering location (column name)
    dumbAI just make random choices
    v2 - smart AI using min/max state exploration?
user interface:
    draw the board
        add pipes or underscores so board not blank
    prompt the user for the column they want to drop their chip in
    ask them if they want to play again
program architecture:
    function to check if a player's won
game mechanics:
    win condition
    adding too many pieces for a column
    fail condition (if board full without win)
