print(f"'Say {Food},' the photographer said as the camera flashed!  {Person} and I had gone to {Place} to get our photos taken today. The first photo we really wanted was a picture of us dressed as {animal} pretending to be a {Profession}. When we saw the proofs of it, I was a bit {Feeling} because it looked different than in my head. (I hadn't imagined so many {Thing1} behind us.) However, the second photo was exactly what I wanted. We both looked like {Thing2} wearing {Clothing} and {verb}--exactly what I had in mind!")
