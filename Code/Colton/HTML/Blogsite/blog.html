            <h5>About Me</h5>
            <p>Now this is a story all about how
                My life got flipped turned upside down
                And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
                I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

                In West Philadelphia, born and raised
                On the playground is where I spent most of my days
                Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
                And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
                When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
                I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air".</p>

            These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations,
                to boldly go where no one has gone before. We need to neutralize the homing signal. Each unit has total environmental control, gravity, temperature,
                atmosphere, light, in a protective field. Sensors show energy readings in your area. We had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator coil. Field
                strength has increased by 3,000 percent.

                Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar
                006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield
                effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without warp drive could cross in the given time.

                We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from
                heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive me if I've said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides
                an abundance of geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.

                It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the brain stem,  the entire nervous system
                has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device like that would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have undergone some kind of selective
                molecular polarization. I haven't determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter the photons with phase discriminators.

                Resistance is futile.

            <p>Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply calibration. Force fields have been established on all turbo lifts and crawlways.
            Computer, run a level-two diagnostic on warp-drive systems. Antimatter containment positive. Warp drive within normal parameters. I read an ion trail
            characteristic of a freighter escape pod. The bomb had a molecular-decay detonator. Detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace frequencies.
