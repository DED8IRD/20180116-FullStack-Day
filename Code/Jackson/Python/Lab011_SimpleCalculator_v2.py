"""
Let's write a simple REPL (read evaluate print loop) calculator that can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division. Ask the user for an operator and each operand. Don't forget that input returns a string, which you can
convert to a float using float(user_input) where user_input is the string you got from input. Below is some sample
input/output.
