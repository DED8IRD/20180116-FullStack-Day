"""
Define the following functions:
peaks - Returns the indices of peaks. A peak has a lower number on both the left and the right.
valleys - Returns the indices of 'valleys'. A valley is a number with a higher number on both the left and the right.
peaks_and_valleys - uses the above two functions to compile a single list of the peaks and valleys in order of
appearance in the original data.
