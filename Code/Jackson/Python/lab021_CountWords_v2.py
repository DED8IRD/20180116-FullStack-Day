Open the file.
Make everything lowercase, strip punctuation, split into a list of words.
Your dictionary will have words as keys and counts as values. If a word isn't in your dictionary yet, add it with a count of 1. If it is, increment its count.
Print the most frequent top 10 out with their counts. You can do that with the code below.
