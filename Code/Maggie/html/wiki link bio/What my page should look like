Wendy Carlos (Born, November 14th, 1939) is an American musician and composer most widely known for  her her electronic compositions and film scores performed on the moog synthesizer. 

In the 1960s she oversaw the development of the new and obscure moog synthesizer. In 1968, she released 'Switched-on Bach,' an album that featured the works of Johann Sebastian Bach on a moog synthesizer. This work brought the instrument into public awareness in the 1970s and earned her three Grammy Awards. Her most notable film scores include A Clockwork Orange, (1971), The Shining (1980), and Tron (1982).
