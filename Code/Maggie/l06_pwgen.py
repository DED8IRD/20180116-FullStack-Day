'''Password Generator. 2018 Maggie Geise

Generate a password of length n using a while loop and ranom.choice, this will be a string of random characters
(Hint: random.choice can be used to pick a character out of a string, as well as element on list)

Bonus: Allow the user to enter the value of n, (remember to convert its type, as input refers to a string)
