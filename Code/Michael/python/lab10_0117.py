# Lab 10: Average Numbers
# We're going to average a list of numbers. Start with the following list, iterate through it, keeping a 'running sum', then divide that sum by the number of elements in that list. Remember len will give you the length of a list.
#
# The code below hows how to loop through an array, and prints the elements one at a time.
#
# nums = [5, 0, 8, 3, 4, 1, 6]
#
# # loop over the elements
# for num in nums:
#     print(num)
#
# # loop over the indices
# for i in range(len(nums)):
#     print(nums[i])
