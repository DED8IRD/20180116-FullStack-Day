<h2>If sleep were a currency</h2>
<p>Time to rest and meditate.

<p>An entire week of sleep would be nice. If only I could bend space-time to do so.

<p>That doesn't sound entirely impossible, seeing as reality isn't real. Time to quote my friend. I don't know if he wants me to say his name though.

<p>Blockchain is cool, kids. I need a vacation. A flotation tank should do it though. Perfect. Sounds like a plan. Oh wait, busy next weekend.

<h2>That place I've never been to but I have</h3>
<p>Nap time. Jk I have to do laundry to do. It might actually be cheaper to buy used clothes than do laundry. Screw my apartment complex. I'm probably dying from the mold.

<p>Time for a road trip down south to see all my friends. Maybe all the way to that one festival in Guatemala that I couldn't get to. Last minute bookings and zero pay, yeah thanks I guess. Oh wait, taxes. Now we're talking. Canada though. I should've factored in the hotels, mileage, and the stress factor at the border while my car got searched for over an hour. It was chill once we got past that though. Then we skipped the entire line at the festival. What a fucking rush for an introvert. It rained halfway through the you know what. It was already drippy enough.
<p>I need some my own personal PK sound system, or a Funktion 1, I guess. My friend can get similar quality for a fraction of the price. Of course he can. We're all in the middle, man, or woman, whatever... It's all good. Shoulda done some Lorem Ipsum text instead. Fuck. Whoops.
