        <blockquote>
"Putting on my power, righteous as a rose
Dynamite the mountain, now I'm walking up the road
The love we made at gunpoint wasn't love at all
The dancing in the valley, the moons is the mirrored ball
Blew open my mind, now it's an empty room
Swinging in the hammock, dogs are walking across the roof
I watch you braid your hair, you're from another time
When the earth wasn't so angry
And god was on our side
Searching west and east
And all points in-between
Underneath the lines of thought
You're there and then you're not
The mayans stole tomorrow, hid it underground
We come with heavy magnets but it still hasn't been found
I'm sweating out my secrets in the temazcal
They're screaming in the calle that there are stars about to fall
Looking through the trees
Cities and the seas
Things we've seen
Ovnis on the lawn
They're there and then they're gone
There and then they're gone
Searching west and east
All points in between
And underneath the hand of god
You're there and then you're not"

          <blockquote>
            "I am all that I think
            I am the way that my neurons are wired
            They fire ions through electrical
            synapses fusing themselves to receiving cells
            building a network that only gets stronger
            as I continue the thought pattern
            implied by the process
            I make a decision on what to react to
            what I perceive based on electrical current
            And I am all that I feel
            I'm my neurotransmitters' desire
            These chemical messengers look for a nerve
            with the perfect receptor to fit in
            They get in and give it specific instructions
            on what to release until this chain
            of events reaches down to the glands which
            then produce every hormone known to
            spread to the tissue of organs
            and make them dance
            All I can do is breathe
            That's how I put out the fire
            And all I can do is think
            and force my circuitry to rewire
            Everything outside is already inside
            There's nothing we see that we don't
            at least partially make on our own
            in our heads so it seems like my duty
            to get in my bio-computer and
            pry apart neurons with long-term relationships
            that tell my brain to release "feel bad" chemicals
            One day I'll be free from the brain
            that makes me "me"
            Now that I know that I'm in control
            I can cut my own puppet strings
            You are all that you think
            You're the way that your neurons are linked
            I bet if you don't let it get a little better
            it will get a lot worse
            All you gotta do is open up and....."
