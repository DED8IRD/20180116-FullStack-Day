        <h3>Cynicism</h3>
        <p>Diogenes was a very controversial figure in ancient Greece, many of his public exploits would land people in a cell in modern times.
        Some of his acts included walking around the markets of Athens with a lamp looking for "An honest man," of course no one would meet his standard of
        honesty and he would belittle the person and move on to the next. Another time Diogenes was being ridiculed by a man for his life-style choice of living amongst
        the dogs in the streets. The man threw scraps of food at Diogenes and for his transgressions against him Diogenes proceeded to urinate on the man
        to prove his point of treating someone like something only encourages them to act like that.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The modern use of the word cynic brings up in one's mind the disdain and disgust that one might view the world in. In ancient times though this
        was hardly the case. The purpose of Cynicism was to live by virtue and in accordance to one's own nature. The main approach Cynics had to this
        idea was to live a life free of possessions, wealth, power, fame or sex.</p>
